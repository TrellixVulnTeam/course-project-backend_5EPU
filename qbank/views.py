In addition to kidney stones, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and muscle weakness, other common manifestations include abdominal pain, constipation, and polyuria or polydipsia.&nbsp; The majority (~80%) of PHPT cases are due to parathyroid adenoma.</p><p>PHPT is commonly associated with <strong>hypertension</strong>; proposed mechanisms include increased renin secretion, sympathetic hyperresponsiveness, and peripheral artery vasoconstriction.&nbsp; Other cardiovascular manifestations of hyperparathyroidism include left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and vascular and valvular calcification.&nbsp; Treatment of PHPT usually results in normalization of blood pressure.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Amphetamine abuse can cause hypertension associated with additional signs and symptoms of sympathetic stimulation (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis, hyperthermia) but would not cause hypercalcemia and kidney stones.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Findings suggestive of Cushing syndrome include central obesity, muscle wasting, thin skin, and abdominal striae.&nbsp; Laboratory findings include hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and hypokalemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Hypertension can be induced by both hyperthyroidism (predominantly systolic hypertension) and hypothyroidism (predominantly diastolic hypertension).&nbsp; Although hyperthyroidism can cause hypercalcemia due to increased bone turnover, hypothyroidism does not have a significant effect on serum calcium concentration.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn syndrome) can cause hypertension and muscle weakness, but it is typically associated with hypokalemia (especially when patients are given diuretics) rather than hypercalcemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Although renal artery stenosis can occur in young women with fibromuscular dysplasia, it is much more common in older men with atherosclerosis.&nbsp; Suggestive findings include resistant hypertension, abdominal bruit, recurrent flash pulmonary edema, and acute kidney injury following initiation of an ACE inhibitor.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Renal parenchymal disease can cause secondary hypertension but usually presents with elevated serum creatinine and abnormal urinalysis.&nbsp; In addition, patients are usually hypocalcemic rather than hypercalcemic.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hyperparathyroidism is a cause of secondary hypertension and should be suspected in patients who have hypertension associated with hypercalcemia, renal stones, abdominal pain, or neuropsychiatric symptoms.&nbsp;

<strong>PAD</strong> = peripheral artery disease; <strong>TIA</strong> = transient ischemic attack.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This patient had an episode of <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong> (AF) that spontaneously resolved within 24 hours.&nbsp; The pathophysiology of AF involves aging and comorbidities (eg, hypertension, heart failure) that cause atrial remodeling and create an <a href=\"46410\">underlying substrate</a> for AF to develop.&nbsp; The substrate creates a lower threshold for <strong>triggers</strong> (eg, binge alcohol intake, hyperthyroidism) to <strong>initiate and sustain</strong> AF; however, sometimes triggers can cause AF in the absence of underlying substrate.&nbsp; After a first episode of AF, patients with risk factors for underlying substrate typically develop recurrent (ie, paroxysmal) or permanent AF.</p><p>In contrast, patients <strong>without risk factors for underlying substrate</strong> (eg, age &lt;50, no significant medical history) are relatively unlikely to experience recurrent AF, especially when the trigger of the episode is removed (eg, cessation of binge alcohol intake, treatment of hyperthyroidism).&nbsp; This is at least part of the reason these patients have <strong>low thromboembolic risk</strong> associated with AF.&nbsp; They often have a <strong>CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-Vasc score of 0</strong>, as in this patient, for which chronic anticoagulation is not indicated.&nbsp; Men with a CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-Vasc score of 1 (or women with a score of 2) also have relatively low thromboembolic risk that may not indicate chronic anticoagulation.&nbsp; In men with a CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-Vasc score &#8805;2 (or women with a score &#8805;3), chronic anticoagulation is indicated and is accomplished via the administration of a direct oral anticoagulant (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) or, less commonly, warfarin <strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Amiodarone is used occasionally for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent, symptomatic episodes of AF (ie, rhythm-control strategy).&nbsp; This patient has spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm, and amiodarone is not indicated.&nbsp; First-line rate control agents (eg, metoprolol) are commonly used but are not needed in patients with relatively low likelihood of recurrent AF.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has shown some benefit in lowering the thromboembolic risk in patients with AF.&nbsp; However, the therapy is rarely used as anticoagulant agents (eg, rivaroxaban, warfarin) provide greater benefit with roughly the same level of increase in bleeding risk.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients without underlying risk factors who develop atrial fibrillation typically have low associated thromboembolic risk.&nbsp; Those with a CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-Vasc score of 0 have low thromboembolic risk, and chronic anticoagulation (eg, rivaroxaban) is not indicated.</p>",

Syncope occurs due to global hypoperfusion of the brain and can have many causes.&nbsp; In most cases, syncope is benign and self-limiting; however, it can be the initial manifestation of a life-threatening disease process (eg, cardiac syncope).</p><p>A detailed initial evaluation can provide several clues to the underlying etiology.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s syncopal episode had <strong>no obvious trigger or prodrome</strong> to implicate reflex syncope; it also did not occur with position change (ie, standing from a seated position) to suggest orthostatic syncope.&nbsp; Instead, the syncopal episode occurred with the patient <strong>at rest</strong> and <strong>without warning symptoms</strong>.&nbsp; This presentation raises concern for a <strong>cardiac etiology</strong>, specifically an <strong>arrhythmic</strong> etiology, and should prompt further cardiac evaluation <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Continuous ECG monitoring</strong> can evaluate for transient arrhythmia (eg, <strong>ventricular tachycardia</strong>) that may not be detected on initial ECG.&nbsp; In relatively young patients (eg, age &lt;40) without structural heart disease, ambulatory ECG monitoring (eg, Holter monitor, insertable cardiac monitor) is usually appropriate.&nbsp; In contrast, patients likely need hospital admission for closer monitoring and expedited cardiac evaluation when they are older, have underlying structural heart disease (eg, prior myocardial infarction), or have an abnormal ECG.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; CT angiography of the chest can evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE), which sometimes presents with syncope.&nbsp; However, other symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea) or signs (eg, hypoxemia, tachycardia) are usually present, and PE is unlikely to account for recurrent episodes of syncope.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Seizure activity (diagnosed on electroencephalography) can cause LOC with jerking movements; however, other suggestive features (eg, prodromal aura, postictal period) are typically present.&nbsp; Muscle jerks can occur in all types of syncope because sudden cerebral hypoperfusion often causes brief myoclonus.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Noncontrast CT scan of the head helps rule out trauma-induced intracranial injury (eg, hemorrhage).&nbsp; It is not indicated in this patient who experienced a relatively low-impact mechanism of injury and has no abnormal neurologic symptoms or findings 2 days after the incident.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with syncope not clearly attributable to a benign etiology (eg, reflex or orthostatic syncope) should undergo further cardiac workup (eg, ambulatory ECG) to determine whether a cardiac etiology is present.&nbsp; Syncope that occurs while supine or sitting, at rest, and without warning symptoms suggests an arrhythmic etiology.</p>",
